This repository contains materials associated with the 2023 MagIC workshop tutorial.

- [1: Introduction and anatomy of a MagIC contribution](1_MagIC_intro/README.md)

- [2: Making a MagIC contribution from measurement data with PmagGUI](2_PmagGUI_intro/README.md)

- 3: PmagPy in action
    - [magnetostratigraphy example](3_PmagPy_in_action/magnetostratigraphy/magnetostratigraphy.ipynb)
    - [inclination shallowing correction + paleomagnetic pole example](3_PmagPy_in_action/Nonesuch/Nonesuch_pmag.ipynb)

## Schedule for the group working sessions and tutorials üóìÔ∏è

| Time  | Theme | Activity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 9:00 - 10:30  | **Introduction to uploading and downloading data from MagIC**  | *We will first go through the steps of uploading a contribution to MagIC using templates. We will then inspect MagIC contributions that are in the database using PmagPy hosted on the EarthRef JupyterHub.* | 
| 10:30 - 10:45  | Coffee Break  |
| 10:45 - 12:00  | **Making a MagIC contribution from measurement data with PmagGUI**  | *We will go through an example work flow of converting from lab format to MagIC format using the Pmag_GUI application that is part of PmagPy. We will make fits to data using Demag_GUI and then create a file that can be uploaded to MagIC.* |
| 12:00 - 13:00  | Lunch |
| 13:00 - 14:45  | **Interacting with MagIC data using Jupyter notebooks**  | *We will continue to use the MagIC API to download data and conduct data analysis and visualizations within notebooks running on the EarthRef JupyterHub* |
| 14:45 - 15:00  | Coffee Break  |
| 15:00 - 16:50  | **MagIC and PmagPy office hours** | This time is designed to be exploration and work time. Talk to folks on the MagIC team and PmagPy developers about MagIC and integrating it into data development and data analysis workflows. We can explore data conversion scripts --- bring your own data! There will also be the option of getting a Thellier_GUI walk through from <a href="https://github.com/bcych" class="user-mention">@bcych</a> |
| 16:50 - 17:00  | **Wrap-up**  |

## More info about PmagPy üêß

The code base for the PmagPy project has been built up over the years by Lisa Tauxe (<a href="https://github.com/ltauxe" class="user-mention">@ltauxe</a>; Professor Emerita at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography). Nick Swanson-Hysell (<a href="https://github.com/swanson-hysell" class="user-mention">@swanson-hysell</a>; Associate Professor at UC Berkeley), Lori Jonestrask (<a href="https://github.com/moonshoes87" class="user-mention">@moonshoes87</a>), and Ron Shaar (<a href="https://github.com/ronshaar" class="user-mention">@ronshaar</a>, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem) have made substantial contributions to the project as have others in the [open community of contributors](https://github.com/pmagpy/pmagpy/graphs/contributors).
